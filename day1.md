# Day 1

## 1. Node.js and its uses
1. A runtime environment enabling server side execution of JavaScript.
1. non-blocking and asynchronous nature

## 2. Limitations of Node.js
1. Single threaded
1. Dependencies
1. Callback Hell

## 3.SQL Databases
1. Vertical Scaling
1. Asynchronous Support
1. Used in bank transactions with strong ACID properties

## 4.NoSQL Databases 
1. Horizontal Scaling
1. Fast Retrieval
1. Efficient management of large volumes of real time data in applications like chat applications.

## 5. Synchronous and Asynchronous nature of JavaScript
1. Synchronous - Executes operations sequentially, with each operation waiting for the previous one to complete.
1. Asynchronous - Enables concurrent execution using callbacks, promises, or async/await, without blocking the main thread.

## 6. Polling in Servers
Regularly checking the server for updates, commonly used in real time messaging applications.

## 7. SQL, MongoDB, and SQLite
1. SQL - used for managing and querying relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.
1. MongoDB - A NoSQL database utilizing a flexible, JSON like document structure, suitable for unstructured data and scalability.
1. SQLite - A lightweight, file based SQL database ideal for small applications, mobile apps, and development environments.
